    Concept
    
    * Give to functional users the possibility to create trigger rules for server actions
    * Make easier to technical users the application maintenance and scalability
    
    Principle
    
    A rule applies to a single object and is composed of:
    1. Triggers on
        * object creation
        * object update
        * object deletion
        * object date (creation date, last update date or another date)
        * object function field recalculation (thus you can trigger the calculation of function fields on cascade)
    2. Conditions
        * operators: you can create your own operators (which apply to current or old field value)
        * value age: current or old values if the rule trigger is the object update
    3. Server Actions
        * all action types: email (native or with poweremail), sms, object creation/update, etc
		* run each action once per instance or once for all instances

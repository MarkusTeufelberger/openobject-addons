    'description': """
    A demo application that you can use to send and receive STOMP messages
    with OpenERP. It can send text messages and OpenERP objects, too.
    Objects sent will be created in the receiving instance.

    The recipient could be the same database from which you sent the message
    or any other. It's easy to set up brokers to reliably deliver
    messages in heterogenous and unrealiable networks.

    Try it with ActiveMQ <http://activemq.apache.org/>, a default install
    should do.

    Compatibility: tested with OpenERP v5.0

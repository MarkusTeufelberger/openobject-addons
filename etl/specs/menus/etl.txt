Terminology
-----------

A job is the definition of the job (like a workflow)

A process is a running job (like an instance of workflow)

A channel is a name on a transition. Components write data to channels.

A connector is the definition of the access on a database, file, ...
    A input/output component can use a connector.

etl.log.channel : different objects to receive some logging data
etl.transition.channel : to select transition to efficiently route different data flow

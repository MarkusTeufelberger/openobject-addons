List of ETL Component:
----------------------

This file must be integrated in menus.txt file.

The following have to be done in the first development phase.
Component marked with (*) are for next phase.

Connectors:
-----------

* DB Connection
* Open ERP Connection
* File Access (ftp, local, http)

Data ETL Component
------------------

1) Input Component :
   -> CSVFile Data component 
   -> ExcelFile Data Component (*)
   -> XMLFile Data Component (*)
   -> Open ERP module (*)
   -> Open ERP MDX Cube Query (*)
   -> Open ERP web-service
   -> SQL Data

1) Output Component :
   -> CSVFile Data component
   -> ExcelFile Data Component (*)
   -> XMLFile Data Component (*)
   -> Open ERP module
   -> Open ERP web-service
   -> SQL Data

3) Object Data (Business Object):

   -> I don't think these are components to develop, it will be an Open eRP
      module that defines a job and several processes, on which you can connect
      using sub-process.

4) Process ETL Component :
    -> Sort process 
    -> Reverse Order process 
    -> Field Mapping Process (like tMap of Talend)
    -> Filtering Row Process
    -> Filtering Column process
    -> Diff (see prototype)
    -> Merge (see prototype)
    -> Search/Replace (from info in the component)
    -> Search/Replace (from another flow)
    -> Uniq Checks Process
    -> Apply/Validate Structure (using a meta data definition)
        -> Add fields (default value)
        -> Check fields (contraints, not null, ...)
    -> Python Code
    -> Fork Flow (duplicate the flow instead of passing 2 pointers)
    -> Split Flow (Conditional, send to different channels based on if)

5) Aggregate component 
    -> Aggregate (sum,avg aggredate function related)

6) Logger ETL Component :
    -> Data Log component (see prototype)
    -> Data Log bloc (log all at once, at the end, keep in memory) (see prototype)

7) Analysis Components (to be connected to a logger or other)
    -> Speed Tests (return a flow with speed results)
    -> Statistics on processed data

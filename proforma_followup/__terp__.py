    'description': """
Once a pro-forma invoice is created, the module sends automatically mail 
and call actions after X days.
It's the same principle than account_followup but for proforma invoice only. 
Only followups by email, no need to do reports. 
Also, at each steps, we should be able to call several functions. 
(for example, if a pro-forma is canceled, it will close a delivery order)

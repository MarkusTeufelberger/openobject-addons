    "description": """
    A complete solution for those companies who use discounts and/or 
    product prices with tax included extensively.
    
    This module is like product_visible_discount but improved in many ways:
      -Properly calculates discounts for any price type, not only list_price.
      -It's able to add/subtract tax from the price before calculating the discount.
      This means you can have for example a 'shop price' calculated with tax included
      and define a price list like 'shop price net -5%' easily.
      -It works with product_price_update that module can mass calculate and 
      update product prices with tax included.
      -A simpler override of the SO's product_id_change, 2 browses and 2 reads less.
      -Purchase Orders can also use discounts if the supplier defines his prices
      with discounts.
      -Even PO's generated with MRP will have the discounts defined in the 
      supplier price list.
    
    Compatibility: tested with OpenERP v5.0

    This module adds cost price in the Process Wizard of the Supplier Return \
Picking, and remove it in the Process Wizard of the Customer Return Picking.

Changes the default formula used in OpenERP to compute the new \
average price of a product in stock in returned pickings, by the next one:

                                      (current_cost_price x current_stock) - \
(returned_cost_price x returned_stock)

    "description":"""Turns production lot tracking numbers into unique per product instance code (serial number).
    Moreover, it
    1) adds a new checkbox on the product form to enable or disable this behavior (you should also enable in/out tracking)
    2) then forbids to perform a move if a move involves more than one product instance
    3) automagically splits up picking list movements into one movement per product instance
    4) turns incoming pickings into an editable grid where you can directly type the code
    of a new production number/code to create and associate to the move (it also checks it
    doesn't exist yet)

    We would also like to extend this module to split automatic production orders (from MRP engine) into several individual production orders in order
    to make it easy to encode the serial numbers in the production. Let us know if you would like that simple extension to be made.

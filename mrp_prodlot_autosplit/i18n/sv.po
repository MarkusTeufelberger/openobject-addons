"Turns production lot tracking numbers into unique per product instance code "
"(serial number).\n"
"    Moreover, it\n"
"    1) adds a new checkbox on the product form to enable or disable this "
"behavior (you should also enable in/out tracking)\n"
"    2) then forbids to perform a move if a move involves more than one "
"product instance\n"
"    3) automagically splits up picking list movements into one movement per "
"product instance\n"
"    4) turns incoming pickings into an editable grid where you can directly "
"type the code\n"
"    of a new production number/code to create and associate to the move (it "
"also checks it\n"
"    doesn't exist yet)\n"
"    \n"
"    Important Note 1: serial numbers are more easily encode using an "
"editable tree grid, including a special field with new serial to be "
"created.\n"
"    However, there is currently a limitation in the OpenObject framework "
"preventing from easily changing non editable trees to editable trees\n"
"    by simple extension. Rather than overwriting all views, we prefer give "
"only one example: the active customied view for easy serial encoding\n"
"    is available using Stock Management > Incoming Products. Looking  that "
"that view definition, the same thing is easily achieved in\n"
"    other picking list, like out going products for instance. However it's "
"not \"on\" by default, you would need to work it out for your case.\n"
"    Meanwhile, we hope Tiny add a third \"merge_attributes\" view extension "
"point to the 3 existing ones: \"before\", \"after\" and \"replace\".\n"
"    It would basically simply merge the attributes given (redefined) in the "
"original view XML and let inner content unchanged.\n"
"    Blueprint is registred here: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openobject-"
"server/+spec/merge-attributes-view-extension-point\n"
"    \n"
"    Important Note 2: this module doesn't split product bill of materials in "
"MRP since they don't use pickings\n"
"    A good workaround when generating production orders manually one by one "
"is too define several lines of individual products in nomemclatures\n"
"    and produce 1 by 1 (if possible) to make it easier to encode unique "
"prodlot in production orders too.\n"
"    We would also like to extend this module to split automatic production "
"orders (from MRP engine) into several individual production orders in order\n"
"    to make it easy to encode the serial numbers in the production. Let us "
"know if you would like that simple extension to be made.\n"

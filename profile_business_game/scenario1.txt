Hello,

For the business game, I need a scenario system that allows to create a
scenario and force the user to do a sequence of steps one after the other. The
first part of the business game will be a simple flow from the quotation to the
customer to the delivery and invoicing, including purchases.

Here is the flow to implement:

Sales Manager:
	Create a Quotation (With 1 PC1, 1 PC2)
	Print the quotation
	Confirm the order

HR Manager
	Print request for quotation
	Change the price to 545 EUR
	Confirm & Approve the RfQ

Logistic Manager
	Receive the products from supplier
	Deliver the products to the customer

Financial Manager
	Confirm the draft Invoice

So each operation have to be done one after the other. If the user
tries to do another operation, the system raise an exception. This
is like a scenario for the firsts steps in the system.

So, can you develop a generic "game_scenario" module that allows
to encode scenario and the system will help the user to do these
scenarios. A scenario is a list of steps with <pre> and <post> actions.

The scenario is defined by a list of steps to perform. I think
you should replace the osv function to test all incoming XML-RPC
request if they match the post_process function of the active step.
Then call this post_process function for all incoming request.

This function can raise an exception if it's not allowed by the
current active step. If not, it performs the method and go the the next steps
(step_next_ids is a many2many).

The post process change the status of the object: business.game.retail.phase1
and store, for example the ID of the generated sale order.

Please contact me tomorrow morning if it's not clear. This ystem is urgent.

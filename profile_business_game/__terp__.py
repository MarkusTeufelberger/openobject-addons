    This business game will help you to discover Open ERP and it's enterprise management processes.
The game is based on a company called 'GoodSound' selling audio and video hardware and organising sonorisation events.

The game is structured into two phases:
   1. You will discover the Open ERP interface through a complete sale flow: from the quotation to the invoice,
   2. The goal of the next phase is to make some strategic choices in the system to increase company's profitability
      within a few turns of one year each.

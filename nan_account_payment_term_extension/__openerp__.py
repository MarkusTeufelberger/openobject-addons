This module extends payment terms with the following features:

- Uses 4 decimal digits instead of 2 for Value Amount field, so percentages can have higher precision.
- Allow using Division, apart from Percentage, so one can ensure only one cent remains in the last term.
- Allow specifing the number of months, which is more usual instead of days in some countries.""",

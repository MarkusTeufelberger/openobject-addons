    "description" : """Import ePassporte Payments from a CSV file.

Adds a wizard in bank statements to select a CSV file with ePassporte payments lines like this:

"Transaction Date","Posted Date","Description","Amount in USD","Balance"
3/27/2009,3/27/2009,"b2p Fee",-2.00,17816.06
3/27/2009,3/27/2009,"b2p particularaccount",-11.17,17818.06
3/23/2009,3/24/2009,"b2b Fee",-2.00,17829.23
3/23/2009,3/24/2009,"b2b businessaccount",-111.51,17831.23

Checks if the bank statement currency and ePassporte file currency (USD in the example) are the same.
Tries to fill the partner information from the ePassporte account (businessaccount and particularaccount in the example). This ePassporte account is searched in the partner bank account field (the bank name of ePassporte accounts must be 'EPASSPORTE').
Tries to conciliate with an open invoice with the same partner, same amount+-0.01 and payment type 'EPASSPORTE'.

First we must define an ePassporte importation configuration:
    * The account for the ePassporte fees.
    * If you want to insert the ePassporte transactions in the bank statement or only show the warning or error messages.

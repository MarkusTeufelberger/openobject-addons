Pexego Account Adminitration Tools

Accounting wizards for administrators:

- Adds a wizard to import accounts from CSV files. This may be useful
    to import the initial accounts into OpenERP.

- Adds a wizard to import account moves from CSV files. This may be useful
    to import the initial balance into OpenERP.

- Adds a wizard to set the receivable/payable account of the partners,
    in moves and invoices where a generic receivable/payable account
    was used instead.

- Adds a wizard to revalidate confirmed account moves so their analytic
    lines are regenerated. This may be used to fix the data after bugs like
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject-addons/+bug/582988
    The wizard also lets you find account moves missing their analytic lines.

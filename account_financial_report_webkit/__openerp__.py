Note : html headers and footers are deactivated for these reports because of an issue of wkhtmltopdf : http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/issues/detail?id=656
       Instead, the header and footer are created as text with arguments passed to wkhtmltopdf. The texts are defined inside the report classes.

This module depends of the pending merge : https://code.launchpad.net/~c2c/openobject-addons/6.0-webkit-improvements/+merge/66428
This merge add the ability to pass dynamically values to html headers and footers.

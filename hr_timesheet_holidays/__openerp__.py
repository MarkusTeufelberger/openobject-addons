"""
Wizard to import holidays in the current timesheet.
This module adds a relation between the Leave Types and the Analytic Accounts.
The Timesheet lines are created on the Analytic Account defined on the Leave Type.

The hours to input per day is configurable at company level.
    
Limitations:
  - Consider that the work days are Monday to Friday
  - The wizard creates the attendances each day with Sign-ins at 00:00 and Sign-outs at (00:00 + configured timesheet hours per day).

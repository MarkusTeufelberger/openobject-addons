  In order to test payment term extension I create a payment terms and check dates.
-
  In order to test the new months field I create a payment terms and check result.
-
  !record {model: account.payment.term, id: account_payment_term_0}:
    name: 3 months
    payment_days: 5-20
    line_ids:
      - name: 3 months
        sequence: 1
        value: balance
        value_amount: 1
        days: 0
        months: 3 
        days2: 0

  I check that due date for 2011-01-31 is 2011-05-05
-
  !assert {model: account.payment.term, id: account_payment_term_0}:
    - compute(3000.0, '2011-01-31') == [('2011-05-05', 3000.0)]
-
  I check that due date for 2011-01-15 is 2011-04-20
-
  !assert {model: account.payment.term, id: account_payment_term_0}:
    - compute(3000.0, '2011-01-15') == [('2011-04-20', 3000.0)]

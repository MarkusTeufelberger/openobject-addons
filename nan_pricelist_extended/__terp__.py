	"name" : "Pricelist Extended",
	"version" : "1.0",
	"description" : """\
Extends pricelist by:
- Adding a category to pricelist items.
- Allowing to accumulate values from several pricelists.
- If a price is not found in a 'based on' pricelist, it will 
  consider it didn't match the current item and move to the next one.

It also allows configuring what kind of rounding happens on pricelists:
- Round to nearest value (default)
- Round up
- Round down
